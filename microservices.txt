Q what is microservices? ===> resource ===> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTAcCNbJ7KE 
ANS Microservices is an architectural style for building software applications as a suite of independently deployable, small, modular services. Each microservice runs a unique process and communicates through a well-defined, lightweight mechanism to serve a business goal. The goal of microservices is to improve speed, scalability, and reliability through fine-grained components that are independently deployable and testable.

Q what is the opposite of microservices architecture (monoglithical architecture)?
ANS The opposite architecture of microservices is often referred to as monolithic architecture. In monolithic architecture, an application is built as a single, tightly-coupled unit, with all components and features packaged together into a single deployable artifact. Changes to any part of the system typically require a full rebuild and redeployment of the entire application. Microservices, on the other hand, allow for more fine-grained and independently deployable components, making it easier to maintain, scale, and update individual parts of the system.


Q when to use microservices architecture?
ANS: 
Microservices architecture is a suitable choice when the following conditions are met:

Large and complex application: If your application is large and complex, breaking it down into smaller, independent services can make it easier to manage and develop.

Independent, autonomous teams: If you have multiple teams working on different parts of the application, a microservices architecture can allow each team to work independently and deploy their services without affecting other teams.

Scalability: Microservices architecture enables scaling individual services as needed, rather than scaling the entire application, which can be beneficial for applications with varying resource requirements.

Technology diversity: Microservices allow you to choose the right technology stack for each service, rather than having to use the same technology throughout the entire application.

Resilience: Microservices can improve the resilience of an application by allowing it to continue functioning even if one service fails.

It is important to note that microservices architecture can come with its own challenges, such as increased operational complexity and inter-service communication overhead, so it is important to weigh the benefits against the costs before deciding to adopt it.



Q when to use monolithical architecture?
ANS
Monolithic architecture is a suitable choice when the following conditions are met:

Small to medium-sized applications: If your application is relatively small and simple, a monolithic architecture can be easier to develop and maintain, as all the components are tightly integrated and can share resources.

Single team development: If your development team is small and working on the entire application, a monolithic architecture can be easier to manage and coordinate, as there is only one codebase and deployment process to worry about.

Fast development and deployment: A monolithic architecture can be faster to develop and deploy, as all components are tightly integrated and can be deployed as a single unit.

Same technology stack: If the entire application requires the same technology stack, a monolithic architecture can be easier to manage, as there is no need to deal with the operational complexities of multiple technology stacks.

Cost: Monolithic architecture can be more cost-effective for small to medium-sized applications, as there is no need to set up and manage multiple services and the infrastructure required to run them.

However, it is important to keep in mind that a monolithic architecture can become unwieldy and hard to manage as the application grows, so it's essential to assess the long-term needs and goals of your application before choosing a monolithic architecture.


Q what are the disadvantages of using microservices?
ANSWER:
While microservices architecture has several advantages, it also has some disadvantages, including:

Increased operational complexity: With microservices, there are many moving parts, and it can be challenging to manage and monitor the health and performance of all the services.

Inter-service communication overhead: Communication between services can add latency and increase the complexity of the system, especially when services are deployed across different geographic locations.

Development and testing complexity: Developing and testing microservices can be more complex than a monolithic architecture, as each service must be developed and tested individually, and there must be a mechanism for ensuring that services integrate correctly.

Deployment complexity: Deploying microservices requires sophisticated deployment automation, as each service must be deployed and managed independently.

Dependency management: Managing dependencies between services can be challenging, especially when services are updated at different times, and there must be a mechanism for ensuring that services continue to work together correctly.

Increased cost: Implementing microservices architecture can be more expensive, as it requires a more complex infrastructure and additional development and operational overhead.

It's important to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of microservices architecture and determine whether it's the right choice for your application based on your specific requirements and constraints.
