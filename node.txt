Q what are the different phases in nodejs
The event loop has several phases, including the following:

The poll phase: the event loop retrieves callbacks from the task queue and executes them.

The check phase: the event loop checks the setImmediate() callbacks, and execute them if necessary.

The close callbacks phase: the event loop checks for and executes close callbacks, such as those for sockets or file handles.

The timers phase: the event loop checks for and executes callbacks for setTimeout() and setInterval().

The idle, prepare phase: internal only phase used by libuv.
